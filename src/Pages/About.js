      <p>
        I made this page to help those entering or returning to the interview
        process. When I started interview prep, I found there to be a lack of
        consistently formatted and explained leetcode solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to make it easier for others to find and understand common
        interview problems. I aimed to have my solutions consistently formatted
        in terms of explanation and code.
      </p>
      <p>Good luck with your interview!</p>
