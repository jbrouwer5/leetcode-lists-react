        <p>
            I made this page to help those entering or returning
            to
            the interview process.

            I found there to be a lack of consistently formatted
            and explained leetcode solutions.

            I wanted to make it easier for others to find and
            understand solutions.

            I aimed to have my solutions consistently formatted in
            terms of explanation and code.

            Good luck with your interview!
